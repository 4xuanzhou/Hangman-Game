# Hangman-Game
Hangman is a 2-player word-guessing game generally played by having one player think of a word and the other player trying to guess that word letter by letter. The computer will pick a random word from a dictionary. A row of underscores represent each letter of the word (e.g. ‘dog’ would be shown to the user as _ _ _). You guess one letter at a time. Every correct letter that they guess is shown in its correct location(s). You have 15 chances to guess. You are not allowed to guess a letter twice. This game has two versions: traditional and evil. In the traditional version of the game, the computer has to stick to the original word as the user guesses; In the evil version, the computer keeps changing the word in order to make the user’s task harder. You won't be told which version you are playing until the game is over.
